# Epic Dungeon Quest
## The pen and paper role playing game

### Initial note: 
All fractions are rounded down to the direct inferior integer (for example: round (4.75) = 4)
Levelling up doesn’t change your character’s stats retroactively (for example you don’t increase your total health just from levelling up your constitution).

## I. Character’s creation 

### At the beginning there was a character

Each role-playing adventure starts with the creation of a character. Epic Dungeon Quest is no different and here are the things you should pick:
- a name
- a race
- an age
- a general look
- a background story

### The races

#### The elves

There are 6 types of elves:<br>
4 elemental elves tribes: wind, earth, fire and water elves,<br>
the high-elves of the Empire,<br>
the night elves of Arclune island. <br>

| Race            | +8 abilities modifier                        | -8 ability modifier                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Elio            | Wind magic, Dexterity                        | Strength, Intelligence                 |
| Sylve           | Earth magic, Constitution                    | Desterity, Intelligence                |
| Hydrile, Ondin  | Water magic, Perception                      | Charisma, Intelligence                 |
| Yfrite          | Fire magic, Strength                         | Strength, Perception                   |
| High-Elf/Elfire | Creation magic, Intelligence                 | Strength, Perception                   |
| Nightelves      | Light magic, Intelligence/Perception (+4/+4) | Strength, Charisma (except on Arclune) |

#### The dwarves

Dwarves can’t wield magic but there are great engineers and skilled craftsmen which can achieve wonders without a drop of magic.
Dwarves have a bonus of +8 in Constitution and in Intelligence but have a malus of -16 in Magic.

#### The orcs

The orcs are fearsome fighters which enjoy freedom before anything else. But the harsh conditions of the wild north where their tribes were push back force them to enrol as mercenaries and risk their lives for others.

Orcs have a bonus of +8 in Strength and in Constitution but have a malus of -8 in Intelligence and Charisma.

#### The humans

Humans can do quite anything, without ever showing any special talents for it. Fighters, merchants, mages, hunters, … the possibilities are countless.

### Where are classes?

Well, there are no classes in Epic Dungeon Quest, you create your own class by performing your own actions and choosing the most suited skills. It works exactly like in Skyrim, the more you do something, the better you get at doing it!

## II. Abilities 

There are seven abilities in Epic Dungeon Quest:

* Strength
Your ability to use brute force to fight or perform any physical effort

* Dexterity
Your ability to use your body with subtlety and precision (dodge, stealth, aim with a bow…)

* Constitution
Your ability to physically resist physical harm, endure pain, perform long efforts (resist to poison, resist passing out…)

* Perception
The sharpness of your senses (visual, auditive, … )

* Intelligence
Your ability to be creative or logical, to remember things, to focus and shape magic

* Charisma
Your ability to inspire people, to make them trust you, your aura, your ability to persuade

* Magic
Your ability to invoke magic or resist its influence


Almost every action in the game will be perform using one of your ability. Ability scores scale from 0 (bad score) to 100 (god score). 

### How to use an ability?

The Dungeon Master determines which ability to use and if there are any penalty on your roll. To use an ability, roll 1d100. If you score below your ability score, your action succeeds.
If there is a penalty on the roll, subtract the penalty to your ability score

Example:
Player : I attack my opponent with my sword
DM : Alrigth, strength test with 20 penalty
Player’s strength is 64. 64 – 20 = 44, player must roll below 44 to succeed.

If you roll 95 or above, this is an epic fail, with consequences for you and your teammates.
If you roll 5 or below, this is an epic success and you succeed in the most difficult actions.

### How to determine my ability scores?

Ability scores are rolled at the creation of your character. To determine your ability score, roll 4d6 , keep the 3 best scores, add them and multiply by 4. Repeat the operation 7 times and then choose which score to use for which ability.


7 times ( [sum of  3 best scores out of 4d6] * 4 )

Example:
 4d6 give you 4, 5, 1, 2. 
Keep the 3 best: 4, 5, and 2. 
Add them: 4+5+2= 11. 
Multiply by 4 : 11*4 = 44. 
44 is your ability score !

### How to level-up my abilities?

Each time you succeed in using one of your abilities, add one to your ability counter. When the counter reaches the corresponding threshold, level-up your ability and reset the ability counter.

| Ability level (current ability score) | Counter Threshold  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 1  - 20                               | 1                  |
| 21 - 40                               | 2                  |
| 41 - 60                               | 3                  |
| 61 - 70                               | 6                  |
| 81 - 90                               | 12                 |
| 91 - 100                              | 20                 |
| 100+                                  | 30                 |


## III. Skills

Skills are special talents or gifts your character has. It gives him bonuses when performing specific actions. You can pick up any skills you want with the DM’s agreement.
The bonus provided by the skill is the level of the skill 

For example:
Player has the skill « water magic casting » with a level of 4 then he can add 4 as a bonus to its magic ability if he uses it to cast water magic.

### At level 1 :
At the creation of your character you have a certain amount of skill points to spend on skills.

Total amount of points = 5 + max[ (int / 4) – 10 , 0] + max[ (per / 4) – 10 , 0]

### Each time you level-up:

Amount of skill point for each level-up = ( max[ (int / 4) – 10 , 0] + max[ (per / 4) – 10 , 0] ) / 4 

(The minimum amount of skill points earned for a level-up is at least 1)

Points can be spent freely on existing skills or new skills which the player decides to add to the existing skills.

Examples of skills :
-Longsword mastery 
-Acrobatics 
-Elemental fire magic
-Sailing 
-Horse riding 
-Forge 
…

## IV. Health points and Mana points

### Health

If your character gets hurt, he loses health points. If the character’s health reaches 0, he passes out and keep losing health point until he manages a constitution check to stabilise his state. An ally can help an injured player and stabilise him to 0 HP.
If a character’s health reaches -10HP the character dies.

### Mana 

PMs are Mana Points. Each time a player casts magic, he uses MPs.

There are 3 different types of magics:

* Creation
The creation magic enables its user to create items by converting MPs to matter. A creation mage usually knows how to wield only one type of material (iron, wood, stone, wax, textile …).
The bigger the creation, the more mana the mage needs to spend.
There are two phases in creation: the design check (intelligence check) and the casting stage (magic check)
Once the item is created, it becomes independent from the caster, as a classic, typical, regular item.

* Elemental magic
There are 4 types of elemental magic: water, earth, wind and fire
The elemental mages use elemental energies flowing in all things to twist and control elements
The more the element is present in an area, the more there is of this kind of energy, the easier it is to call to this element.
Elemental mages cast magic in two stages also (intelligence check then magic check) but don’t lose control over the element after using it (contrary to creation mage).

* Divine Magic
Priests and believers can call to their gods to receive their benediction and subsequently get buffs or buff allies or debuff opponents. (Only magic check is required most of the time)

You get Health and Mana back by resting. PMs comes back more quickly than HPs.

### At level 1 :

HPs = 10 + max[ con/4 -10 , 0 ] + max[ str/4 -10 , 0 ] 
MPs = [ max[ con/4 -10 , 0 ] + max[ mag/4 -10 , 0 ] ] * 2 

### At next level-ups:

HPs = PV + [ max[ con/4 -10 , 0 ] + max[ str/4 -10 , 0 ]  ] / 4 
MPs = PM + [ max[ con/4 -10 , 0 ] + max[ mag/4 -10 , 0 ] ] / 4 

At level-up, the player should get at least 1 more HP and 1 more MP.


## V. Level-ups
 
Your general level rises depending on the number of successful ability checks performed 
The player counts the total amount of successful ability checks. Then if this counter reaches the threshold of 3 + level of the player, then the player level-up and reset the counter. 

Ex: player level-up from level 1 to level 2 after 4 successful ability checks, from level 2 to level 3 after 5 successful ability checks.
Each time the player level-up, he gets HPs, MPs and skill points.
